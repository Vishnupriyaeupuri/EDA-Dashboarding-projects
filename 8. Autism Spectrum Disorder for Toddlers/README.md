# 🧩📊 Understanding Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) using Data Visualization Techniques

## Project Overview
This project aims to understand Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) using data visualization techniques. ASD affects social interaction and behavior, making it challenging to diagnose. By analyzing data on toddler screening responses, we aim to uncover patterns that could aid in early diagnosis and better support for affected families.

## 📊 Data Tables
- 📋 Demographics Data
- 📋 Behavioral Responses Data
- 📋 Screening Results
- 📋 Data Cleaning Log
- 📋 Visualization Data
- 📋 Analysis Data

## 📈 Approach
We analyze the dataset using various visualizations:
1. 📊 Bar Graphs
2. 📈 Scatter Plots
3. 🌡️ Heat Maps
4. 🗺️ Geographic Mapping
5. 🥧 Pie Charts

## 📂 Data
The dataset contains 1,054 responses from toddler screenings, including demographics and behavioral responses. This data is sourced from Kaggle.

### 🗃️ Data Attributes
- **Nominal Data**: Categorical attributes like gender and ethnicity.
- **Continuous Data**: Quantitative measures such as age in months.

## 🛠️ Data Preparation
Data cleaning involves handling missing values, standardizing formats, and transforming categorical responses into numerical values for analysis.

## 🔍 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Using Python libraries like Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Plotly, we perform EDA to uncover trends and correlations:
- 🔗 **Correlation Analysis**: Understand relationships between variables.
- 🕵️ **Outlier Detection**: Identify and address anomalies.
- 🧮 **Descriptive Statistics**: Summarize dataset characteristics.

## 🛠️ Tools Used
- 💻 **Google Colab**: Web-based platform for data analysis with Python.
- 🐍 **Python Libraries**: Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly for visualizations.
- 📊 **Tableau**: For creating dynamic, interactive visualizations.

## 📊 Preliminary Results
Key visualizations include:
- 🥧 **Pie Charts**: Show distribution of ASD traits.
- 📊 **Bar Graphs**: Compare responses across demographics.
- 🌡️ **Heat Maps**: Highlight correlations between behavioral features.
- 📈 **Scatter Plots**: Visualize relationships between different variables.
