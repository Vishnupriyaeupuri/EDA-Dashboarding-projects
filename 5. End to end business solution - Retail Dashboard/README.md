# End to End Business Intelligence Solution - Retail Dashboard

I embarked on a mission to design and deliver a comprehensive business intelligence solution that would provide invaluable insights for the company's growth. The challenge was to track essential KPIs such as Net Sales, Profit, Orders, and Returns while highlighting products with the highest return and refund rates. Additionally, I needed to present these insights on a monthly, weekly, quarterly, and yearly basis. To achieve this, I took on the task of downloading the dataset, employing my ETL skills, and crafting an intuitive dashboard that would demonstrate my design and analytical capabilities. 
To begin, I sourced the dataset from Kaggle, a rich platform for real-world datasets. My approach followed a structured path. I initiated necessary data cleansing and transformation steps using Power Query Editor, ensuring data integrity and consistency. This led to the creation of two impactful dashboards. 
## Dashboard 1: Detail Analysis
The first dashboard held an array of vital KPIs - Net Sales, Profit, Transactions, and Order Quantity. Each KPI was adorned with a trend analysis displayed across various timeframes - Day, Month, Year, and Quarter. Ease of navigation was embedded with buttons that facilitated toggling between diverse KPI analyses. The masterstroke, however, was the implementation of Bookmarks. This transformed the dashboard into an impeccable visual representation of data, delivering insights with clarity.

## Dashboard 2: Return Analysis
This dashboard delved deep into return dynamics. Insights into Refund Quantities, Refund Values, and Refund Rates were meticulously summarized. The centerpiece was a dynamic bar visualization, unveiling the top products and customers by refund quantity. A simple yet impactful button mechanism allowed users to swiftly transition between Customers and Products. The portrayal of the refund trend alongside a Scatter plot comparing Refund Value and Gross Revenue further enriched the analysis.

## Other Components:
An additional dimension was introduced through detailed reports on Products and Customers. 

This project not only showcased my ability to work with complex datasets but also underscored my mastery of Power BI tools. The innovative use of Bookmarks and Buttons allowed me to present the insights in a coherent and interactive manner, enabling stakeholders to make informed decisions with ease. As a result, this endeavor stands as a testament to my growth as a data analyst, as I harnessed the full potential of Power BI's features to create a transformative business intelligence solution.
